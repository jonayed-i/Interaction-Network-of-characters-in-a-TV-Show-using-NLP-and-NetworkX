# Interaction Network of characters in a TV Show using NLP and NetworkX
 
Analysis of interactions between My Little Pony Characters. The scripts from season 1 of My Little Pony were parsed and analyzed using NLP techniques to determine which character was speaking to which one. 

This data allowed me to determine who was the most popular character.
